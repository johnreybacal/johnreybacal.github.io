                didn't take it? Regret. I have countless regrets in my past, some I could never forget. But at my 20th
                birthday, I just started to accept things for what they are and not think about it, I can no longer do
                anything about my past but to accept it. Acceptance.</p>

                        are not responsible for their perception of you. Be free, you are too be beautiful to be locked

            <p class="center-paragraph">So you're a developer like me? I got some tips for you!</p>
            <p class="center-paragraph">Be a good programmer. Good programmers doesn't necessarily mean that you can
                easily code anything in a short amount of time, for me it is making codes that are clear and easy to
                understand. Each programming language has it's own coding standards, practice that and your team will
                love you.</p>
            <p class="center-paragraph">What I love most about programming is that it challenges me. I even prefer
                finding a bug because it let's me investigate further through the code. Most programmers hates seeing
                bugs in their code but I think they should see it as an opportunity to improve their skills and their
                code.</p>
